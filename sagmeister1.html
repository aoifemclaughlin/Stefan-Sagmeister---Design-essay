    Stefan Sagmesiter is one of the most influential designers today. Best known for his wacky, outrageous designs he challenges society and has a firm grip on his job as a designer. Having established his own company, Sagmeister Inc, in 2012 he changed the company’s logo from an “S” to an “&” after recruiting Jessica Walsh. The company is now Known as “Sagmeister & Walsh’ and is still based in New York doing work for many clients including Levi's, Droog, AIGA and the Museum of Modern Art only to name a few.

    Sagmeister was born in Bregenz, Austria on August 6th 1962. After graduating from college Sagmeister had originally intended to become an engineer, However he swiftly changed his mind and decided to change his course to Graphic Design. He eventually made it into the University of Applied Arts Vienna. Here he was awarded an M.F.A and was granted a Fulbright scholarship to continue hes studies at Pratt institute in New York. He briefly returned to Austria to do community service for obligatory military servies.

    From the age of 15 he started working for the magazine Alphorn and quickly realised his passion for design. His first professional industry job was for Leo Burnett in their office located in Hong Kong. Later he became greatly influenced by another rebellious designer, Tibor Kalman.

    Eventually, Sagmeister began working for M&Co in 1993. While working here, he had learnt that Kalman had another talent, knowledgable and experienced advice. However the company soon shut it’s doors abrubtly and Sagmeister decided to open his own company much like his “hero”, Kalman.

    Sagmeister could be described as a fearless designer. His work is highly unorthodox, for example, when he announced he was opening his own company, Sagmeister Inc. he posed completely naked for two photos. Likewise, when he announced Jessica Walsh was his business partner, both individuals posed naked side by side. I think it’s fair to say many people would think of this as a bold and daring move, however I think it shows the dedication both designers have to their job.

    Some of Sagmeister's most famous work comes from music. After M&Co shut its doors, he decided to turn his interests to designing CD covers.

<blockquote>I get a bigger kick out of meeting some of my musical heroes than sitting in meetings with a marketing director, which I did a lot before I opened my own specialized studio</blockquote>

    He seemed to relish the idea of working for each individual artist and creating covers based on what he felt from      the music and the personality of each artist. Probably his most famous CD cover was for Lou Reed, Set the Twilight Reeling.
</p> 
<blockquote>We tried to illustrate the metamorphosis from his dark prince character to a new found man by utilizing a deep blue tinted jewel case in combination with a very bright printed portrait of Lou on the booklet cover.
Opened up, the back of the booklet, the design of the CD itself and the tray card together form a diagram of an eclipse, - the ultimate twilight. The typographic style inside reflects the content of the lyrics.</blockquote>
<p>
    I think what Sagmeister has done here is very clever. He has placed the image in an indigo tinted CD case, so when you remove the image from its case it appears as though Lou Reed truly appears out of the twilight. Sagmeister also designed the poster for the release of the album. On it, an image of Lou Reed with song lyrics placed on top of the image. The song lyrics are very personal to the artist so Sagmeister thought this would work well as the lyrics written on his face reflected the intimacy of the lyrics.

    In 2000, Sagmeister again designed another CD cover for Reed, Ecstasy. For this cover, Sagmeister asked Reed to masterbate behind a curtain while he was being photographed. This would then show Reed in a state of pure bliss and satisfaction or Ecstasy. Personally, I think this is brilliant. Not only is it clever and smart, but it’s very out there. What other artist has an image of themselves masturbating on the cover? For most it could come across as a little weird or creepy, but here I think it just works exceptionally.
